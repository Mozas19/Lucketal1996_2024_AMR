The fidelity in the translation of terms has been a crucial aspect in the replication of this study.

The conservation of the original pairs has been prioritized to ensure the comparability of the results.

However, due to linguistic and cultural limitations, as well as the brief response time of the participants,
it has been necessary to modify some of the pairs. These changes have been made in an effort to preserve the original
semantic relationship while maintaining, as much as possible,
the grammatical structure of the original pairs. (nombre-nombre, verbo-verbo).
