# Lucketal1996_2024_AMR
This repository is a sample of what I learned during my master's thesis in the Neuroimaging group of Prof. Guiomar Niso Gal√°n at the Cajal Institute, CSIC. It includes the first Python codes I developed, which contributed to the replication of Luck et al. (1996) Nature study on attentional blink, within the #EEGManyLabs initiative.
