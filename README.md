# Lucketal1996_2024_AMR
This repository is a sample of what I learned during my master's thesis in the Neuroimaging group of Prof. Guiomar Niso Gal√°n at the Cajal Institute, CSIC. It includes the first Python codes I developed, which contributed to the replication of Luck et al. (1996) Nature study on attentional blink, within the #EEGManyLabs initiative.

As a table of contents, I will specify below the content of each of the folders in this repository.
  1. wordpair_x: In this folder, we can find a .xlsx file with the list of original words in English and their translation into Spanish. Additionally, a .py file that takes the words from this file and formats them as we desire for the RSVP. I also leave the .xlsx file that should come out as a result.

  2. random_wordlist: This folder contains 2 .py files, which randomize the words from the original list to give them a different order and another that formats them as we desire for the RSVP. As in the previous file, I am leaving the .xlsx files that should be the result.

  3. AB_RSVP_ESP: I am leaving in this folder the same files that are found in Prof. Guiomar Niso's repository of the current state of the PsychoPy code for the RSVP, with slight modifications. Well, this folder contains all the necessary files for the experiment to run in Spanish, and it is the code we are using to conduct the test trials.
