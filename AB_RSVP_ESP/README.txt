The present code has been developed collaboratively by the #EEGManyLabs initiative, with special mention to Prof. Yuri G. Pavlov, who has been responsible for writing the code for PsychoPy.

These files are ready to be downloaded and run on any version of Psychopy after 2024.1.0.
The .xlsx and .csv files have been modified to run the experiment in Spanish.

The results at the end of each run are saved as a .csv in the Data folder, next to the DS_Store file.
To modify the number of loops/trials in a run, it is necessary to change both the task_type.xlsx and the experiment in PsychoPy.
